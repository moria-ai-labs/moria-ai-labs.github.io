## What is Data Readiness?

Data Readiness is an outcome-centered evaluation of the journey from insights to data sources. 

## What's the difference between data quality and Data Readiness?

In most cases, data quality is table/asset centered. Current data quality solutions provide assessments of the asset data quality without considering how data sources connect with each other. More importantly, data quality alone does not answer the question: "how might we understand [insert business performance outcome]?"
